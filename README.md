- Generates frequency spectrum using the JONSWAP spectrum equation via compute shaders
- Converts frequency into time domain by leveraging the Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm to perform the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)
- Includes sub surface scattering, specular and environment reflections, and foam accumulation
- Wind direction and speed, ocean depth and fetch, and numerous other parameters can be tuned for any desired effect

## Example 1 - Light Winds
