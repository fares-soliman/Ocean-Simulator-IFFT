- Generates a frequency spectrum using the JONSWAP spectra equation and compute shaders
- Converts frequency into time domain by levereging the Cooleyâ€“Tukey algorithm for the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)
- Includes sub surface scattering, specular and environment reflections, and foam accumulation
- Wind direction and speed, ocean depth and fetch, and numerous other parameters can be tuned for any desired effect
